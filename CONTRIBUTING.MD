If you write a new function, add a comment at the beginning of the function with your username in it (do not change or add comments to existing functions!!)

NEVER push code to the main branch. Always push it to the beta branch (see `BETA.MD` for more info).

That way, your contributions won't cause rampant bugs that breach production and cause problems (see #3
