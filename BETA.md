# Beta testing
BirdPad has a beta branch for the purposes of tracking code changes across time and to provide a sneak peek at future functionality.

The code in the beta branch is likely unstable and may not function. Furthermore, no buildkits will be supplied for beta code.

# If you really want to test out beta code
If you are unfazed by the above warnings, you can attempt to test out beta code by downloading the `birdpad.py` file from the beta branch and the most recent stable buildkit from the Releases tab.

Transplant the beta `birdpad.py` into the buildkit and build as normal. An executable built for your system will be placed in the `dist` folder.
