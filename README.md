# birdpad
A minimalist but good-looking text editor for Windows and macOS.

I created this project while on the search for a text editor that felt native to my machine.

WordPad and Notepad served very well for a while, but with Windows 11, WordPad was deprecated and Notepad started looking like a generic web app, so I had to continue looking.

Then, I rememebered BirdPad, an old hobby project I'd made privately a few months prior.

I improved the UI and added functionality, and BirdPad as we know it today was born.

Now, I've added support for macOS, and I've improved window resizing greatly.

# Requirements
- Either an x86_64 Windows PC or a Mac with macOS and Apple Silicon
- ~10 megabytes of unused space

# Installation
Open the Releases tab, and download the latest build for your device.

BirdPad is portable, but on macOS you can always drag it to your Applications folder.
